Stay safe and connected with Krizo - the ultimate SOS and tracking app

## Overview

Krizo is a revolutionary SOS and tracking app designed to keep you safe and connected at all times. Whether you're hiking in the wilderness or traveling abroad, this app has got you covered. With just one tap, you can send out a distress signal to your designated emergency contacts and share your location with them. Plus, the tracking feature allows you to keep tabs on your loved ones and make sure they're safe. This app will run in the background once you set it on, and you can decide a keyword which is unique and unsuspicious, and when you feel you are in trouble you can say that word and krizo will send a message to the contacts which you have added as trusted ones and they will get a location tracker link. By which they can easily find you and save you. Don't let emergencies catch you off guard and be prepared for any situation.
